        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Phantom Rocks Opera!</strong>
            <p>The digital book and movie are excellent quality! I always loved Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, but I
                hadn't read the book until now. Leroux's writing style is witty despite the serious subject. It's
                interesting to see a lawyer's take on the gothic horror genre. The novel is an excellent addition to
                your POTO collection. Purchase this set. You won't be disappointed!</p></li>
            <li><strong>Katniss Everdeen is a Strong Female Role Model!</strong>
            <p>The Hunger Games trilogy provides a strong female character in Katniss Everdeen, brought to life in the
                films by Jennifer Lawrence. The Hunger Games will make you cheer and cry for the protagonist with its
                edge of your seat, thrills and heartbreakingly, beautiful moments. Purchase this set. And remember, "May
                the odds be forever in your favor."</p></li>
            <li><strong>Frankenstein is not the Monster!</strong>
            <p>Who would have thought a person's dream could inspire this masterpiece. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein
                after a nightmare she had about a creature. The rest, as they say, is history. The novel is a classic
                for a reason. Antiheroes and empathetic characters draw you into the plot, and you will be glued to your
                seat until you finish it. The film directed by Kevin Connor, is a sensitive portrait of the monster who
                longed to be a man. I can't encourage you enough to purchase this duo.</p>
