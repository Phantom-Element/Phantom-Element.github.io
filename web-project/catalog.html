            <p>
                Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a gothic classic that all are familiar with but may not have read.
                Some may think of the monster strapped to a table and being brought to life by lightning. The novel
                digs deeper than the classic monster movie and provides commentary on society and what it means to
                be human. The accompanying film directed by Kevin Connor and starring Donald Sutherland provides an
                astounding visual of this classic tale. <br><br>
