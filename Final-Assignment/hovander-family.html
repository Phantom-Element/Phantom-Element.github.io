            <p>Hakan Hovander was a Swedish architect (b. 1841 d. 1915). He immigrated with his family <br> to Whatcom
                County in 1898. Hovander bought the acreage with his namesake that same year. <br> In 1901, Hovander
                began
                building the 6800 square feet house that is now standing in Hovander. <br>
                After Hovander passed away in 1915, his children scattered but his son Otis remained at the homestead
                <br>
                with his mother until her passing in 1936.</p>
